Modify and run `tgtfiles/gentgts` to make new tgt files.

To run the experiment, type

```
output = main([id], [tgtfile], [fullscreen]);

```

Where id is some numerical value for the subject id, tgtfile is the name of the
target file (e.g. 'block1_nchoice2.csv'), and fullscreen is boolean (false for
debugging).
